🔷 **DIABETES PREDICTION**
Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 **Description**
This project uses three machine learning models — Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost — to predict whether a person is likely to be diabetic based on health and lifestyle attributes.

⚙️ **Models Used**
    -> Decision Tree

    -> Random Forest

    -> XGBoost

📊 **Evaluation Metrics**
    Model	        Accuracy	F1-Score
    Decision Tree	~72%	     0.73
    Random Forest	~74%	     0.75
    XGBoost	        ~75.2%	     0.76

📈 **Dataset Info**
    Total records: 70,692

    Target: Diabetes (binary classification)

    Attributes: 21 health-related features (e.g., BMI, BP, Smoking)
    Note:
        -> This dataset is a balanced dataset which is collected from the kaggle (url: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset?select=diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")
        -> This dataset doesnot have any null values or anamolies and also only selected features are include for model building.

🧪 **Future Improvements**
    ->Hyperparameter tuning

    ->Feature engineering

    ->Use SHAP for interpretability

    ->Balance dataset using SMOTE
