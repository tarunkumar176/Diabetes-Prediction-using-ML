🔷 **DIABETES PREDICTION**
Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 **Description**
This project uses three machine learning models — Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost — to predict whether a person is likely to be diabetic based on health and lifestyle attributes.

⚙️ **Models Used**
    -> Decision Tree

    -> Random Forest

    -> XGBoost

📊 **Evaluation Metrics**
    Model	        Accuracy	F1-Score
    Decision Tree	~72%	     0.73
    Random Forest	~74%	     0.75
    XGBoost	        ~75.2%	     0.76

📈 **Dataset Info**
    Total records: 70,692

    Target: Diabetes (binary classification)

    Attributes: 21 health-related features (e.g., BMI, BP, Smoking)

🧪 **Future Improvements**
    ->Hyperparameter tuning

    ->Feature engineering

    ->Use SHAP for interpretability
